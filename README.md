# CSS Display Property Visualizer

This web application is a simple, interactive tool to help visualize the behavior of CSS `display` properties: `block`, `inline`, and `inline-block`.

It is perfect for beginners and learners who want to understand how these display modes affect element rendering and how width and height are applied (or not).

## ðŸš€ Features

-  **Display Mode Toggle**: Switch between `block`, `inline`, and `inline-block` to see how layout behavior changes.
-  **Resizable Boxes**: Adjust width and height dynamically using sliders (only works for `block` and `inline-block`).
-  **Non-resizable Inline Elements**: Demonstrates that `inline` elements ignore width and height settings.
-  **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile screens.
-  **Visual Explanations**: Shows descriptive text explaining the behavior of each display mode.

## How It Works

- When the page loads, the default display is `block`.
- Buttons allow switching between display modes using JavaScript event listeners.
- Width and height sliders dynamically change the box dimensions, except in `inline` mode.
- Descriptions guide the user on whatâ€™s happening with each display setting.
